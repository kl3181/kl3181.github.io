### Hometown
Rockville, MD

### Graduate Focus
Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics. I am currently writing my thesis on the association between inflammatory markers and risk of pancreatic cancer.

### Interesting Fact
I once lived on a farm for a month in Panama conducting interviews with the community on gender roles in agriculture - spoiler alert they still exist.

### Post-Graduation Plans
I would love to work in as a data visualization analyst or in a field where I can combine my background in statistics and data with a graphic element.
